# Clustering-of-Hydrological-Stations
With the help of machine learning clustering algorithms hydrological stations are clustered in coherent groups 

## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project is to cluster hydrological stations in switzerland. Based on their discharge behaviour and their temperature course over the last fourty years.
This clustering can be used for optimization in training of a graph based deep neural network and may be of help to account for missing data.
